# DigitalClock
Digital Clock, developed using HTML CSS JS
This is an HTML document that creates a digital clock webpage. The webpage consists of a container with a clock element displaying hours, minutes, and seconds. Additionally, there's a navigation section providing links to the creator's GitHub, LinkedIn, and CV. The lower part of the page shows the current year, month, day, and day of the week. The clock and date are dynamic and likely powered by JavaScript, as indicated by the external script reference to "index.js". The overall design is enhanced by an external CSS file linked in the head section.
